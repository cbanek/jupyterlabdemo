Welcome to the LSST Jupyterlab demo environment.

The LSST stack is in /opt/lsst/software/stack . Source the appropriate
setup script there to create an LSST environment in a terminal:

source /opt/lsst/software/stack/loadLSST.bash

If you want to add your own configuration to LSST stack startup in the
LSST iPython kernel, create a sourceable shell fragment in
${HOME}/notebooks/.user_setups and it will be sourced during kernel
startup.
